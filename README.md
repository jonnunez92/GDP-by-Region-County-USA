# GDP-per-Region-County-USA

- Using data downloaded from the website data.world and sourced from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, I have created two visualizatons to illustrate where the USA's GDP comes from. 
- The first visualization shows the average GDP from each of the eight economic regions of the US as a barchart. I even included a map from the BEA that shows where each region is. 
- The second visualization shows the GDP of the top 5 counties also as a barchart, though, not as an average in this case, but as the real number.
